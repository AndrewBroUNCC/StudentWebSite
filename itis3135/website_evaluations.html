            <h3><a href="https://www.chase.com/" class="hyperlink-text">Chase Bank</a></h3>
            <p>A professional looking website from a bank. You can tell that a team of people work together to keep this site up to date and 
                stylish. 
            </p>
            <ul class="evaluation-table">
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Chase Bank's webpage shows contrast with there use of colors which makes it simple to navigate.
                They show repetition by bringing up checking and credit cards quite often in the page. they also 
                use the same color layout through the webpage. The page is aligned well the space between the pictues are 
                also perfectly spaced. the proximity of the page is set up nice and clean with the elements of the 
                page are spaced well and not to near or far from each other.
            </p>

        <section class="bad-webpage">
            <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/" class="hyperlink-text">Arngren</a></h3>
            <p>This website is used to sell products some how. they seem to slack off quite alot when it comes to
                 updating the webpage. Chrome will translate the site to english.</p>
            <ul class="evaluation-table">
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Alignment</li>
                <li>Proximity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Arngren is a mess of chaotic and distractive movement. it looks like a dumpster fire of broken links and 
                hours of confusing links to browse with. the contrast is horrible and the repetition of pictures is overwhelming. 
                the alignment is non-existent and some picture seen to overlap. the proximity of the picures words and everything else 
                just seem to have zero personal space.
