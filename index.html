        <h3>Andrew Brown</h3>

        <p>Hello everyone,  welcome to my student webpage. I am a graduate from the University of North Carolina at 
            Charlotte with a GPA of 3.90. I am chasing after a carrer in web and moblie application Development!
              I have had so much fun learning how web development works and have become addicted into 
              learning more. Below is a list of personal hobbies I like to do.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Personal Hobbies</h3>
        
        <ul>

            <li>I play video games when i have free time. (currently on Assassin's Creed Valhalla)</li>

            <li>Watching movies and television shows.</li>

            <li>I love some good food (who doesnt right), as well as trying new food.</li>

            <li>I try to listen to audibles at least 30mins a day.</li>

            <li>I love art and the mint museum</li>

            <li>I also like listening to 80's rock and the 2000's alternative music.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Thoughts on College in general</h3>
        
        <p>
            I think there alot of concepts that were thaught that I will never use sadly. I would of 
            prefered more time in the course that I had my focus on. online classes are quite a bit harder

            example: I had calculus 1 online and I think the teacher was dead. He would not respond to emails and
            would not post anything ever. the entire class was graded online automatically. YouTube taught me calculus.

            How could that ever be appropiate? 
            
            Now I am finally into my third year and also enrolled in a University instead of a community college! 
        </p>
